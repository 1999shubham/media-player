Fixed bugs with volume and mute when starting playing tracks.
5th August 2013 v0.0.0.3 
Changed Previous Track control to restart same track if the play time is greater than 3 seconds, if less than 3 seconds the previous track is started
Added default path the mplayer on a raspi, so that mediaplayer should still work if the app.properties file is not present
30th Sept 2013 v0.0.0.4
Added support for the MPD player, which can provide gapless playback
Added a check for 'AUDIO/X-MPEGURL' for unknown url types
Added config options enableAVTransport and enableReceiver to add support for more Control Points
12 November 2013
Added InputSources.xml for configuring sources, added to main code and there is a plugin for controlling GPIO pins.
Now added pi4j to main app, but only initiated if running on a Raspi, needs to be in the mediaplayer_lib, this allows mutliple plugins to share the same GPIO object

Fixed issue with the Volume value when a USB DAC does not support hardware volume
Fixed issue when shutting down if Pi4J had not be initialized
2 December 2013
Changed the way the volume is handled for USB DAC that does not support hardware volume control, now we keep the -1 value internally and return zero to the control point, but if the volume is less than zero we do not set the volue or mute
